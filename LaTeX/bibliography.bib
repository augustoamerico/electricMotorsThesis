	abstract = {This is a revision of Guru/Hiziroglu: Electric Machinery and Transformers, 2/E. The text is designed for the standard third or fourth year (junior/senior) course in electrical engineering commonly called electric machinery or electromechanical energy conversion. This text discusses the principles behind building the primary infrastructure for the generation of electricity (such as hydroelectric dams, turbines, etc.) that supplies the energy needs of people throughout the world. In addition to power generation, the book covers the basics of various types of electric motors, from large electric train motors, to those in hair dryers and smaller devices. The largest markets for a book such as this will be found in countries with developing infrastructures. The text is best known for its accuracy, pedagogy, and clear writing style. This revision should make Electric Machinery and Transformers the most up-to-date text on the market. Electric Machinery and Transformers continues its strong pedagogical tradition with a wealth of examples, new exercises, review questions, and effective chapter summaries. Electric Machinery and Transformers begins with a review of the basics of circuit theory and electromagnetics. Chapter 3 begins the heart of the course with the principles of electromehcanical energy conversion; Chapter 4 covers transformers; Chapters 5 and 6 cover direct current generators and motors; Chapters 7 and 8 cover synchronous generators and motors. Chapters 9 and 10 round out the motors coverage with an introduction to polyphase induction motors and single-phase motors. Finally, Chapter 11 deals with dynamics of electrics machines and Chapter 12 covers special purpoe machines. This revised second edition features updated examples for modern applications, new problems, and additional material on power electronics. An instructor's manual will accompany the main text and will be available free to adopters.},

However, condition monitoring for this type of drive configuration remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes an impedance identification approach to detect and locate the stator turn-to-turn fault in a multiple-motor drive system. Sensitive and fast fault detection is achieved by utilizing the characteristics of current regulators in the motor controller. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reliably detect and locate the stator turn fault on two shaft-coupled 5-hp induction machines under different operating conditions and fault levels with no need of any machine parameters. Although originally developed for multiple-motor drives, the detection scheme can also be directly applied to most of the conventional closed-loop induction motor drives.},

The major theoretical principles related with the EPVA are presented and it is shown how stator winding faults can be effectively diagnosed by the use of this noninvasive approach. Experimental results, obtained in the laboratory, corroborate that these faults can be detected, in the EPVA signature, by the identification of a spectral component at twice the fundamental supply frequency. Onsite tests, conducted in a power generation plant and in a cement mill, demonstrate the effectiveness of the EPVA in the detection of these faults in large industrial motors, rated up to 5 MW},

    abstract = {Insulation faults in electrical rotating machines are a matter of great industrial interest since the economic losses associated with these events are usually equal or even higher than the cost of the machine itself. For this reason, the development of monitoring and diagnostic techniques to detect this failure during its earliest stages has been a subject of great interest. On the other hand, the accuracy of the quality controls applied to the manufacturing of insulation systems is an essential issue to reduce fault rate and increase machine life. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of the scientific literature in this field, including not only research papers but also existing standards for off-line tests. A critical review of their diagnosis capability, especially on low voltage machines, is essential to clarify the reliability of these techniques as well as the convenience of its generalized industrial use. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

    abstract = {In this paper, a new method, called Park-Hilbert (P-H), is presented and used to detect inter-turn short circuit in three-phase induction motors. This technique is based on spectral analysis, via the FFT, of a new generated signal called PVM {\textless}inf{\textgreater}P-H{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} which represents the Park's vector modulus computed starting from the analytical signals obtained from the three-phase current by the Hilbert transform. A theoretical analysis is performed in order to show how the proposed method works. Various experimental tests carried out on a 3 kW three-phase induction motor, illustrate the efficiency of this new method and show that some spectral components of the PVM {\textless}inf{\textgreater}P-H{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} are extremely sensitive to the occurrence of shorted turns. However, it is shown that the information about the motor state is distributed on many spectral components and in order to gather these useful information, the present paper suggests the monitoring of a new fault indicators computed starting from the most sensitive harmonics (basing on the multiple signature processing). This technique is applied on the proposed signal PVM {\textless}inf{\textgreater}P-H{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ; and the experimental tests confirm that a small number of shorted turns can be effectively detected using these new fault indicators even under low load. A comparative study with the conventional MCSA and EPVA methods is also performed. The obtained results show the superiority of the P-H method and prove the effectiveness of the proposed fault indicators for extracting useful information from any motor signal. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.},

    abstract = {This paper proposes new expressions of symmetrical components (SCs) of the stator currents of the induction motor (IM) in steady state and under different stator faults, useful to ensure an efficient fault diagnosis. In this paper, the considered sta- tor faults are interturns short circuit, phase-to-phase, and single- phase-to-ground faults. An analytical study of the behavior of these expressions shows that, under balanced supply voltage, the phase angle and themagnitude of the negative- and zero-sequence currents can be considered as reliable indicators of stator faults of the IM. The behavior of the developed expressions of the SCs is also verified experimentally on a 1.1-kW IM under different fault conditions, different frequencies, and different load conditions. The good agreement between the analytical and experimental values leads to consider the negative- and zero-sequence currents as powerful and effective indicators of stator faults.},

    abstract = {Induction motors are used in industrial, commercial and residential applications because they have considerable merits over other types of electric motors. These motors are used in various operating stresses that give rise to faults. Most recurrent faults in induction motors are bearing faults, stator interturn faults and cracked rotor bars. Early detection of induction motor faults is crucial for their reliable and economical operation. This could be done by motor monitoring, incipient fault detection and diagnosis. In many situations, failure of critically loaded machine can shut down an entire industry process. This growing demand for high-quality and low-cost production has increased the need for automated manufacturing systems with effective monitoring and control capabilities. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of an induction motor are of great importance in the production line. It can reduce the cost of maintenance and risk of unexpected failures by allowing the early detection of catastrophic failures. This work documents experimental results for multiple fault detection in induction motors using signal-processing and artificial neural network-based approaches. Motor line currents recorded under various fault conditions were analyzed using continuous wavelet transform. A feedforward neural network was used for fault characterization based on fault features extracted using continuous wavelet transform.},

To demonstrate our design, we implement it using 3 software radios, each sampling the spectrum at 50 MS/s, producing a device that captures 0.9 GHz - i.e., 6{\&}{\#}x00D7; larger digital bandwidth than the three software radios combined. Finally, an extension of BigBand can perform GHz spectrum sensing even in scenarios where the spectrum is not sparse.},

Analytical consideration which sheds light on some components of the stator current spectra of both healthy and faulty machines is developed. It is shown that, as a result of the nature of the cage rotor, no new frequency components of the line current spectra can appear as a consequence of the fault. Only a rise in some of the frequency components which already exist in the line current spectra of a healthy machine can be observed. An experimental setup comprising a 3 kW delta-connected motor loaded by a generator was used to validate this approach. The experimental results obtained clearly validate the analytical and simulation results},

    abstract = {In this paper, an online induction motor diagnosis system using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) with advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms is proposed. MCSA is a method for motor diagnosis with stator-current signals. The proposed system diagnoses induction motors having four types of faults such as breakage of rotor bars and end rings, short-circuit of stator windings, bearing cracks, and air-gap eccentricity. Although MCSA is one of the most powerful online methods for diagnosing motor faults, it has some shortcomings, which degrade performance and accuracy of a motor-diagnosis system. Therefore, advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms are proposed. They are composed of an optimal-slip-estimation algorithm, a proper-sample-selection algorithm, and a frequency auto search algorithm for achieving MCSA efficiently. The proposed system is able to ascertain four kinds of motor faults and diagnose the fault status of an induction motor. Experimental results obtained on 3.7-kW and 30-kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors and voltage-source inverters with a vector-control technique are discussed},
