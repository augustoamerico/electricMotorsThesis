@article{Guru2001,
	abstract = {This is a revision of Guru/Hiziroglu: Electric Machinery and Transformers, 2/E. The text is designed for the standard third or fourth year (junior/senior) course in electrical engineering commonly called electric machinery or electromechanical energy conversion. This text discusses the principles behind building the primary infrastructure for the generation of electricity (such as hydroelectric dams, turbines, etc.) that supplies the energy needs of people throughout the world. In addition to power generation, the book covers the basics of various types of electric motors, from large electric train motors, to those in hair dryers and smaller devices. The largest markets for a book such as this will be found in countries with developing infrastructures. The text is best known for its accuracy, pedagogy, and clear writing style. This revision should make Electric Machinery and Transformers the most up-to-date text on the market. Electric Machinery and Transformers continues its strong pedagogical tradition with a wealth of examples, new exercises, review questions, and effective chapter summaries. Electric Machinery and Transformers begins with a review of the basics of circuit theory and electromagnetics. Chapter 3 begins the heart of the course with the principles of electromehcanical energy conversion; Chapter 4 covers transformers; Chapters 5 and 6 cover direct current generators and motors; Chapters 7 and 8 cover synchronous generators and motors. Chapters 9 and 10 round out the motors coverage with an introduction to polyphase induction motors and single-phase motors. Finally, Chapter 11 deals with dynamics of electrics machines and Chapter 12 covers special purpoe machines. This revised second edition features updated examples for modern applications, new problems, and additional material on power electronics. An instructor's manual will accompany the main text and will be available free to adopters.},
